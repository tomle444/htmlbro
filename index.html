<h1>Welcome to HTMLBro</h1>
<p>HTMLBro is a Jekyll theme that is built using the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap Framework</a>. This is a customizable theme that can be made to be personalized for your needs.</p>

<h2>What is Jekyll?</h2>
<p>Jekyll is a blog-aware, static site generator. The great thing about serving up a good ol' web page in a series of .html files is because it's 100% secure. No databases or account logins and passwords to worry about.</p>

<p>Combine Jekyll with <a href="#">Github Pages</a> and you can have a quick and easy website for just the cost of a domain name, which is relatively cheap these days.</p>

<h2>Liquid coding</h2>
<p>Jekyll uses Liquid code to create these static sites. You can store data within <code>_config.yml</code> files and use Liquid code to loop through values.</p>
